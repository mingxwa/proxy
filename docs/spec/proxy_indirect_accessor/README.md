class proxy_indirect_accessor;
```

Class template `proxy_indirect_accessor` provides indirection accessibility for `proxy`. Let `Cs` be the convention types of `F` and of every super of `F`, reachable via `typename F::super_types` transitively, and `Rs` be the reflection types of `F` and of every such super. The *descriptor* of a type `C` in `Cs` is [`proxy_operation`](../proxy_operation.md)`<typename C::dispatch_type, `[`substituted-overload`](../ProOverload.md)`<typename C::overload_type, F, MP>>`, and the *descriptor* of a type `R` in `Rs` is [`proxy_reflection`](../proxy_reflection.md)`<typename R::reflector_type>`.

The *access type* of a type `C` in `Cs` or `R` in `Rs` is `typename C::access_type` or `typename R::access_type` if it is a valid type, or `void` otherwise (see [*ProBasicConvention*](../ProBasicConvention.md) and [*ProBasicReflection*](../ProBasicReflection.md)). For each distinct access type `A` of the types `C` in `Cs` where `C::is_direct` is `false` and of the types `R` in `Rs` where `R::is_direct` is `false`, let `Ds...` be the descriptors of those conventions and reflections whose access type is `A`, with duplicates removed. If `A` meets the [*ProAccessible* requirements](../ProAccessible.md) of `proxy_indirect_accessor<F, MP>, Ds...`, `typename A::template accessor<proxy_indirect_accessor<F, MP>, Ds...>` is inherited by `proxy_indirect_accessor<F, MP>`.

*Since 5.0.0*: `Cs` and `Rs` include the conventions and reflections of the supers of `F`, and each accessor is provided by an access type and formed from the descriptors of every convention and reflection in `Cs` and `Rs` sharing that access type. Previously, each accessor was provided by the dispatch type of a single convention or by the reflector type of a single reflection. `proxy_indirect_accessor` also takes a metadata policy.
